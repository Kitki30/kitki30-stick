# Translation rules

1. Don't use swear words
2. Use some effort
3. Fit in 30 character limit, less is better for small screens
4. Use english only characters, VGA font doesn't support other.
5. Leave spaces as they are, even on the start/end of string
6. Some strings are more than 30 character long, they are probably popups, you can bypass the limit here
7. Don't PR untested translations (Please test them so they don't come out of screen)
8. DO NOT EDIT KEYS (``{ "key": "value" }), ONLY VALUES, OR ELSE YOUR TRANSLATION WILL NOT WORK!!!
